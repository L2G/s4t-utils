This gem contains libraries and commands that are used in the
book _Everyday Scripting with Ruby_. It was created by the book's author,
Brian Marick.

Only a handful of other Ruby gems are known to rely on s4t-utils. Only one of
them, user-choices, is still popular. Another one, gossip, has lay dormant
until now. I am trying to revive that one.

So I am also trying to dust off s4t-utils--not to build on it, but to keep it
compatible with Ruby 1.9 and to allow its own tests to work. Hopefully by the
time Ruby 2.0 is out, nothing will have to depend on this. :-)

If you are looking for the last released version of the code, and you came
here because you couldn't find it anywhere else, you may download it here:
