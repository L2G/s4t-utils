Version 1.0.5 (in development)
  * IMPORTANT: s4t-utils is nearly at the end of its useful life. There
    are no plans for further development except to address
    compatibility problems in Ruby >= 1.9.2. If you are still
    using s4t-utils, it is time to migrate.
  * assert_true and assert_false have been reworked to fix
    warnings and errors in 1.9.x.
  * set_script_lib_path finds its place by looking for directories 'lib'
    and 'test' in the same place. (Formerly it looked for 'lib', 'test',
    and 'setup.rb', and didn't care whether or not they were directories.)

Version 1.0.4
  * Merged two Rakefiles into one concise one.
  * Added "hoelike" - extensions to hoe tasks.

Version 1.0.3
  * Added with_stdin and capturing_stdout
  * Added set_test_paths and set_script_lib_path
  * pi can take symbols as captions.
  * Added without_pretty_indentation and has_exact_prefix?
    The names were chosen to be so bad there'd be little 
    chance of name clashes. 

Version 1.0.2
  * Added user_denies as an alias for user_disputes.

Version 1.0.1
  * Added user_is_bewildered to claims.rb

Version 1.0.0
  * Made into a gem.
  * Minor improvements to some methods.
